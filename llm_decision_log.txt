Momentum is weak: RSI at 48 (neutral but declining from overbought levels), MACD histogram negative (-0.437) and below signal line, StochK at 50 (neutral). Volatility remains elevated (annualized ~37%). Recent bounce from 177 to 182.77 shows some mean-reversion, but price failed to hold above 180 resistance. Volume on Dec 4 was below average (128.6M vs 190.6M avg), suggesting lack of conviction. Given the downtrend structure, weak momentum, and resistance near moving averages, a pullback is more likely than a sustained rally."}
